Program Description:
--------------------
This program checks if the digits of a given number are in strictly increasing order from right to left. It iterates through each digit of the number and outputs "Yes" if the digits are strictly increasing, otherwise it outputs "No" at the first occurrence of non-increasing digits.

Test Cases:
-----------
1. Input: 12345
   Output: Yes
   Explanation: Digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are in strictly increasing order.

2. Input: 98765321
   Output: No
   Explanation: Digits (9, 8, 7, 6) are not strictly increasing as '8' follows '9'.

3. Input: 111
   Output: No
   Explanation: Digits (1, 1, 1) are not strictly increasing as they are all equal.
