Program Description:
--------------------
This program calculates the circumference and area of a circle based on the input radius. It uses the value of pi (π) as a constant for accurate calculations.

Test Cases:
-----------
1. Input: 5
   Output:
   Length = 31.4159
   Area = 78.5398
   Explanation: For a circle with radius 5 units, the calculated circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 5 = 31.4159 and the area is πr^2 = π * 5^2 = 78.5398.

2. Input: 0.5
   Output:
   Length = 3.14159
   Area = 0.785398
   Explanation: For a circle with radius 0.5 units, the calculated circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 0.5 = 3.14159 and the area is πr^2 = π * 0.5^2 = 0.785398.

3. Input: 10
   Output:
   Length = 62.8319
   Area = 314.159
   Explanation: For a circle with radius 10 units, the calculated circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 10 = 62.8319 and the area is πr^2 = π * 10^2 = 314.159.


Program Description:
--------------------
This program implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Test Cases:
-----------
1. Input: {14, 33, 27, 10, 35, 19, 42, 44}
   Output: 10 14 19 27 33 35 42 44
   Explanation: The array {14, 33, 27, 10, 35, 19, 42, 44} is sorted in ascending order using bubble sort.

2. Input: {5, 1, 7, 3, 9, 2, 6, 4}
   Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9
   Explanation: Another example where the array {5, 1, 7, 3, 9, 2, 6, 4} is sorted in ascending order using bubble sort.

3. Input: {50, 30, 20, 10, 40, 60, 70, 80}
   Output: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
   Explanation: Sorting the array {50, 30, 20, 10, 40, 60, 70, 80} results in {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80} using bubble sort.
