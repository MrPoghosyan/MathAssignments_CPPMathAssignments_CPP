Program Description:
--------------------
This program calculates the circumference and area of a circle based on the input radius. It uses the value of pi (π) as a constant for accurate calculations.

Test Cases:
-----------
1. Input: 5
   Output:
   Length = 31.4159
   Area = 78.5398
   Explanation: For a circle with radius 5 units, the calculated circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 5 = 31.4159 and the area is πr^2 = π * 5^2 = 78.5398.

2. Input: 0.5
   Output:
   Length = 3.14159
   Area = 0.785398
   Explanation: For a circle with radius 0.5 units, the calculated circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 0.5 = 3.14159 and the area is πr^2 = π * 0.5^2 = 0.785398.

3. Input: 10
   Output:
   Length = 62.8319
   Area = 314.159
   Explanation: For a circle with radius 10 units, the calculated circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 10 = 62.8319 and the area is πr^2 = π * 10^2 = 314.159.
