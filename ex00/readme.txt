Program Description:
--------------------
This program determines the position of a given point (x, y) relative to a circle centered at (0,0) with radius r.
It outputs:
- "YES (On the circle)" if the point lies exactly on the circle's circumference.
- "YES (Inside the circle)" if the point lies inside the circle.
- "YES (Outside the circle)" if the point lies outside the circle.

Test Cases:
-----------
1. Input:
   Radius (r): 5
   Point (x, y): 3 4
   Output: YES (Inside the circle)
   Explanation: The point (3, 4) is inside the circle with radius 5.

2. Input:
   Radius (r): 3
   Point (x, y): 3 0
   Output: YES (On the circle)
   Explanation: The point (3, 0) lies exactly on the circle with radius 3.

3. Input:
   Radius (r): 7
   Point (x, y): 8 8
   Output: YES (Outside the circle)
   Explanation: The point (8, 8) is outside the circle with radius 7.
